# HyperPageRank
PageRank computation with Web Hypergraphs

Final project for Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures class at UQAC Autumn 2016.

The algorithms are inspired on the work of the following article : http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~nivio/papers/sbbd07.pdf

To run the program, you must have a nodes file and an edges file of your web graph following the same structure as example.nodes.txt and example.edges.txt which are in this repository.
You can compute Indegree and PageRank algorithms for a simple Graph (ie: a node is web page and an arc is a link from one page to another) or a hypergraph (ie: web pages are gathered in hyperedges according to their domain name and a hyperarc is a link from of the webpage of an hyperedge to another page).
